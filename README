How to compile and run (on linux):
 1. Get gradle, see here: 
    http://www.gradle.org/installation
    (3 steps: download, unpack, add to PATH)
 2. Build the jar file:
    On the command line, while in the WeaveAlign directory, run:
    $ ./build.sh
    Or alternatively you can call gradle directly:
    $ gradle jar
 3. Run the example:
    $ ./run-example.sh
