How to compile and run (on linux):
 1. Get gradle, see here: 
    http://www.gradle.org/installation
    (3 steps: download, unpack, add to PATH)
 2. Build the jar file:
    On the command line, while in the WeaveAlign directory, run:
    $ ./build.sh
    Or alternatively you can call gradle directly (it is necassary to run the "copyToLib" task before running):
    $ gradle jar copytolib
    (this will download dependencies if needed and run all the tests as well)
 3. Run the example:
    $ ./run-example.sh
