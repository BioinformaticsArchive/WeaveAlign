How to compile and run (on linux):
 0. Prerequisites: You'll need java JDK.
 1. Install gradle (if you don't have at least version 1.5), run:
    ./install_gradle.sh
    Or install a version by hand, see here:
    http://www.gradle.org/installation
    (3 easy steps: download, unpack, add to PATH)
 2. Build the jar file:
    On the command line, while in the WeaveAlign directory, run:
    $ ./build-all.sh
 3. Run the example:
    $ ./run-example.sh
