 1. Get gradle, see here: 
    http://www.gradle.org/installation
    (3 steps: download, unpack, add to PATH)
 2. Build tha jar file 
    On the command line, while in the WeaveAlign directory, run: 
    $ gradle build jar
    (this will download dependencies if needed and run all the tests as well)
 3. Run the example
    (TODO)
